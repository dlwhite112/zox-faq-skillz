        That's not good! Typically, we've found that this issue is caused by
        emails going to your spam folder. If that's not the case, your email may
        have bounced from your email provider. This usually happens when your
        inbox is full, your email provider was down, or the message was too
        large for your inbox.

        If you have lost or forgotten your password, don't worry, it's very easy
        to fix. All you will need to do is go{" "}
        <a href="https://zox.la/account/login">here</a> and click the 'Forgot
        Password' link. That should bring you to a page to enter your email and
        a message will be sent over to set a new password.

        If you have tried the above step and had an error saying you do not have
        an account. That would mean that you did not create an account prior to
        ordering or after you ordered. That is very easy to fix as well, to
        create an account with any previous order history you will need to click{" "}
        <a href="https://zox.la/account/register">here.</a>.<br />

          Make certain you use the same email address that you initially used
          for your order and it should sync correctly for you and have your
          points automatically added in.
