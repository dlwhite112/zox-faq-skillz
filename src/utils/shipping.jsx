        We've worked hard to find the best rates. We offer free shipping on all
        orders of wristbands of $35+ to nearly every country. If your order is
        less than that, then your shipping fees will be calculated at checkout
        based upon your location.

        <br />
        Hoodies are only available in a limited number of countries. Most are
        free, but some are a $10 extra charge to help us cover our costs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Duties may be due at the border for some international shipments and are
        not covered in the purchase price our our products.{" "}

        If you reach out to us quickly enough via live chat or the contact form
        at the top of this page we will try our best to adjust that shipping
        address in time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the
        adjustment before the order ships out due to the high volume of messages
        we receive and how quickly orders are going out everyday. We will give
        it our best efforts though and provide options for what can be done if
        the order has gone out and has the wrong address on it. ðŸ˜€

        If the package has already been shipped out or delivered to wrong
        address on file (and cannot be changed). We have to charge shipping
        costs for the reshipment the original costs has been already been
        charged on the original shipment.

        If your order just shipped out it will typically take between 24-72
        hours during business days (Monday-Friday) before you see updates.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your order was showing tracking updates and stops showing them. Wait
        until it has been your anticipated shipping time, then please reach out
        to us and we'll get that taken care of for you.
        <br />
        <br />
        For international orders, if the last updates shows 'Processing
        Completed At Origin' it typically it takes a few business days to update
        as arrived in your country. It can take up to 2 weeks before scanning in
        as arrived in your country. If you any concerns, let us know and we can
        take a look at what we have seen lately for your country.
