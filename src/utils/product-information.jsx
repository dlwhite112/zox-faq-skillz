      <p>
        ZOX are buttery-soft elastic wristbands made made from recycled plastic
        water bottles!

        Though the latex is typically not visible (each strand of latex is
        encased in polyester), you may experience discomfort if you're allergic
        to latex. In that case, we'd recommend collecting our imperial+ or
        metlets which are latex-free.
