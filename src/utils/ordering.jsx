      <p>
        I'm so sorry but at this point in time we can not offer personal ZOX. We
        totally understand there are certain meanings or designs that you or
        loved ones are drawn to. Please be sure to check out our{" "}
        <a href="https://zox.la/pages/collections">Shop</a> page and you may
        just be able to find something similar to what you're looking for.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have an idea for a ZOX design, please join{" "}

      <p>
        1. You cannot use multiple discounts at the same time.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Some discounts only apply to specific items and will not apply if the
        item is not in your cart.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. You have already used the discount on a previous order so it is no
        longer valid.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. You can not discount subscriptions as they process through a separate
        platform for checkout.
        <br />
        <br />
        We hope this helps! ðŸ˜€

      <p>
        I'm so sorry to hear that! If you reach out to us quickly enough via
        live chat or the contact form at the top of this page we will try our
        best to adjust that order in time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that we can make the
        adjustments before the order ships out due to the high volume of
        messages we receive and how quickly orders are going out everyday. We
        will give it our best efforts though! ðŸ˜€
