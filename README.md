## General info :

Initial Approach:

Approaching this project, my goal is to accomplish a finished result as close to identical results as possible. The only requirement technology was React.js so there was always the possibility of using maybe Material UI or Bootstrap components to save time, but I chose to stick to React.js and pure CSS.

I am currently working full-time. I could only devote one day of uninterrupted coding block ~ 4Hours. The day before, I spent the afternoon doing a little sectioning, planning, and inspecting the source code.

Reassessment:

At the half-time break in the assignment, I realized I probably would not have enough time to recreate the FAQ section in its entirety so I elected to just feature the first three questions under each category to save a little time.

Conclusion & Future Development:

In the end, I ended up curbing some of the animated transitions (ex. ease in & out of the answer content for each question) to get a better result at my stopping point.

As for Future Development Ideas, from a visual design standpoint, some improvements in relative spacing, white space, limiting the use of italicized text and bold text, adjusting text size. This could probably benefit my layout. Moreover, the FAQ section could benefit from sectioning those nine current categories into separate accordions sections because the FAQ is such a long section for a user to have to sift through. Assuming a user knows what their question is, it is unnecessary to display all sections and all questions at once. It could also probably increase loading times to shorten the section in general.

Overall the exercise was a little challenging. I could have benefited from spending more time on the functionality aspect. You can't submit a Front-end Exercise that is not pleasing to look at. üòÇ üë®üèø‚Äçüíª
